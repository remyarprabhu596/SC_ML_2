# SC_ML_2
Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their income and spending behavior using K-Means Clustering. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to support data-driven marketing strategies.

# 🧠 Task 2 – Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, helping businesses understand their customer base for targeted marketing.

 📌 Objectives

- Analyze customer demographic data
- Group similar customers using unsupervised learning
- Visualize customer segments clearly

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

 🔍 What I Did

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data
- Used **StandardScaler** for feature scaling
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers
- Determined optimal clusters using the **Elbow Method**
- Visualized clusters and interpreted business insights

📊 Key Learnings

- Importance of feature scaling in unsupervised ML
- How K-Means Clustering works
- How to find the right number of clusters (Elbow Method)
- Real-world applications of customer segmentation
- Data visualization for business insights

📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains customer information such as:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

📈 Output
- Scatter plot of clusters
- Optimal cluster identification
- Summary of customer segments

 🚀 Outcome
This project helped me understand how **unsupervised machine learning** can provide **valuable business insights** by grouping customers with similar spending behaviors.
